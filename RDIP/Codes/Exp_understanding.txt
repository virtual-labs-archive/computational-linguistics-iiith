Forming Sentences (Given experiment)

Using Javascript, HTML and CSS, we have to replicate the given experiment. 
We have to form complex sentences.

Possible languages : Hindi, English

On selecting a language, a sentence will be provided in a jumbled format which then has to be rearranged to make a meaningful sentence.

The experiment being on "Forming Sentences": there can be a couple of correct answers.

Various buttons need to be placed such as "Check the correctness of the answer" -> Gives the statement "Correct" or "Wrong"

If correct there should probably be an option that provides a new sentence(not visible currently in the sample provided).
The English and Hindi Sentences are randomly chosen from a list of sentences. Every time English or Hindi is chosen, a new random English/Hindi Sentence comes into play. (This functionality is missing)


If Wrong -> A show correct answer button should display the correct one. 
This can be hidden again on clicking a "Hide button".

A reform button should again place all the jumbled words back in its position, for the user to try and formulate the correct response again.
