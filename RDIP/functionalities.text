When I press the experiment it shows the box like "select language" it shows options to select.
After selecting a language it shows boxes with test words that are random in nature.
We need to form a correct sentence through random words after formation 
It shows two options 1.Reform the sentence 2.Check the correctness of this sentence
if we press the reform the sentence it goes back to previous state. or If we press the check the correctness of this sentence it shows the result 
if it is right it shows correct answer otherwise it shows the box as "Get convert answer"
