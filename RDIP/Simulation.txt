List of all the functionalities :
  
  1. Whenever the wrong sequence is created by the user, then we have a button created as Get Correct Sentences. If we click on that button, then we can see 
     so many random sequences of sentences that can be generated from the given words. In which the correct sentence is the first that is displayed upon hitting that button.
     
  2. If the pattern is wrong the message is called as "Wrong answer !!!". Then a button will automatically generated as "Get Correct Sentence" upon pressing it multiple
     times the button gets changed to "Get Answers" and it displays all the random sentences and it changes "Hide the correct Sentence".
